# Applying a Maintenance Page

## Overview

This document will serve as a guide on how to add a maintenance/decomission
page to your application on Cloud Platform live.

## Deploying the page

A repository has been created to store all the files related to the
maintenance/decomission page:

[cloud-platform-maintenance-pages](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-maintenance-pages)

All instructions on how to create a new maintenance/decomission page are within the `README.md` at the above repository and the below files:

* [Maintenance Pages](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering/blob/gh-pages/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/maintenance_request.md)
* [Decommission Pages](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering/blob/gh-pages/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/decomission_request.md)

The above files can be created into tickets on the operations-engineering GitHub/Zenhub using the New Issue button. It is highly recommended to create a ticket and follow
any new changes through the ticket as it has checklists to follow progress.
