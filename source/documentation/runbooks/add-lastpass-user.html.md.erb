# Add New LastPass User

These processes are for adding new users to the Ministry of Justice Enterprise LastPass account.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

* Access to [LastPass Admin console](https://admin.lastpass.com/dashboard)
* New user name and work email address
* Approval from [Group Owner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O58JjeYRWm1_K4zWCkcrQKy_aE1O7s5b_GtBmQpFPCQ/edit?usp=sharing) to add new user.
* Details of the LastPass "Group" (this defines which credentials a users will have access to)

**LastPass is only available to MoJ users/teams. We do not give access to 3rd party suppliers or anyone without an @digital.justice.gov or @justice.gov.uk email address.**

**LastPass is also only for shared Team credentials. Users must be added to a "Group". If access if just for personal use only, refer then to the [Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp).**
