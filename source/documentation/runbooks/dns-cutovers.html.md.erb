# Supporting migrations / DNS cutovers

The purpose of this runbook is to provide guidance and tips when supporting migration projects that involve DNS changes.

## Before implementation

### Can we support weekend or out of hours work?

Operations Engineering does not offer any out of hour or weekend support for services. If asked, we should challenge any requests and try to schedule work within normal working hours. 

Under exceptional circumstances, it may be appropriate to support changes out of hours, including weekends to mitigate risks, or due to contractual constraints. In this instance seek approval from the Product Manager or Head of Hosting before agreeing to any scheduling and let the rest of the team know.

### How should DNS changes be submitted?

Ensure that all required DNS changes are submitted in writing by the requestor to domains@digital.justice.gov.uk.

This should include any supporting runbooks or other documentation.

If there is a bridge call related to the work, please add invite details to the shared Operations Engineering calendar for visibility.

### Check that Operations Engineering manages the domains

Operations Engineering manages a vast majority of the MoJ DNS estate. However, things to look out for:

1. Have a good look round AWS Route53. We manage a lot more domains than just `justice.gov.uk` and `service.justice.gov.uk`. If the hosted zone of domain doesn't appear in there, then we probably don't manage it.

2. If the domain doesn't appear, it may still be worth looking in Route53 `Registered Domains`. If we have registered the domain then it must be somewhere in Route53. Keep digging. 

3. If a domain is in Route53, but is a subdomain that is an NS Record type then chances are it's a nameserver delegation to another AWS account that we don't manage or to another hosting platform, and therefore we probably don't manage it.

4. If we don't manage a domain then it is sometimes worth trying a Whois search. That may point you to who has registered a domain and who might manage it so that you can point people to the right team.

5. If we can't find the record of a domain but it is associated to an HMCTS service then it may be owned by the HMCTS Ops Team (opsconfman@hmcts.net).

6. If it is a service hosted on Cloud Platform or Modernisation Platform the DNS will be managed as code and owned by the respective teams. You should point requesters to #ask-cloud-platform or #ask-modernisation-platform.

7. If we can't find any records of a domain it may still be worth checking [BT DNS](https://www.dmc.bt.com/). We do have some `gov.uk` domains that are registered and managed by BT.

### A few days in advance reduce TTL on DNS records

A few days in advance of changes you should consider reducing the TTL for DNS records that have long durations. Recommended that TTL be reduced to 300 seconds. This will help with DNS propagation and caching issues.

### You can't create CNAME record that matches the name of the Hosted Zone

You just can't. If that is required (e.g. pointing a domain an Azure landing zone) then this will require [redirection of a domain using AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/redirect-domain-route-53/).

You may need to allow extra time to create S3 buckets and CloudFront in advance of changes. Remember that when agreeing schedule for changes.

### Backup DNS records

In case changes need to be backed out you must back-up the current DNS records that are being changed. There is no specific tool for doing this but ensure that wherever you back-up to you can access the back-up easily. Also consider saving the back-up in a shared location if someone else in the team might need to assist.

### What are the escalation/reporting routes during the migration?

Get confirmation of who you report completion of changes to, and what the escalation route is in case of emergency. If access to 3rd party tooling is required for this process check you can access those tools in advance of the change window and report any issues back to the project.

## During implementation

### How to change changes have propagated?

You can check that DNS changes have taken effect by running a [Dig command](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-dig-command-to-query-dns-in-linux/) in a Terminal session.

### Browser caching issues

Sometimes DNS changes to do appear to have worked. This may be due to browser caching. It is always worth asking implementation team or testers to clear their browser cache or try the URL in an incognito browser.

### Who is responsible for testing that migration is successful?

That's the responsibility of the migration team, not Operations Engineering. The migration team is responsible for signing off that migration is successful.

### Don't be a hero

DNS changes can cause all sorts of problems. Our DNS estate is large and complex. **If something goes wrong don't be a hero**. Ask for help if in hours. If out of hours and there is no one to help it's ok to back out changes. No one will thank you for a critical system being down on a Monday morning.

### Do JISC support out of hours changes?

**No**. JISC manage the domain lock service that prohibits changes on certain domains. 

Any work requiring support from JISC should only be arrange in working hours, Monday to Friday.
