# Redirecting Domains

This runbook provides details of approaches to redirecting domains. There are different approaches depending on the scenario. Use this guide to identify the most suitable approach.

## Why might we need to redirect a domain?

There are a number of scenarios in which we may want to redirect a domain:
* decommissioning of a service
* replacement of a non-gov.uk domain with a gov.uk domain
* migration of a service from one domain name to a new domain name
* migration of a service to gov.uk

## CNAME redirection

This is the simplest form of redirect. You can use a [CNAME record](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html#CNAMEFormat) to redirect one domain to another e.g. redirect `example.service.justice.gov.uk` to `example.justice.gov.uk`.

This approach won't work where a `CNAME` shares the name with it's `Hostedzone` e.g. you can't create a CNAME `example.justice.gov.uk` in the Hostedzone `example.justice.gov.uk`. In this case you will need to redirect using AWS S3.

## Redirection with AWS S3 (HTTP traffic)

A more complex form of redirect will involve using AWS S3 to 'host' your redirection. This process involves creating a public S3 bucket which contains a website redirect. This is a standard feature of AWS S3.

Follow the [AWS documentation](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/redirect-domain-route-53) to set this up.

Few things to note when creating a redirect:
* S3 buckets are created in the MoJDSD AWS account
* This type of redirect won't work for HTTPS traffic. Instead see Redirection with AWS S3 (HTTPS traffic)

## Redirection with AWS S3 (HTTPS traffic)

A more complex form of redirect involving AWS S3. This type of redirect needs to be used where a service needs to process traffic over HTTPS. This type of redirect needs to include a TLS certificate, but that in turn needs the use of AWS CloudFront. This type is more complex as it needs creation of more AWS resources.

Follow the [AWS documentation](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/redirect-domain-route-53) to set this up.

Few things to note when creating a redirect:
* All AWS resources are created in the MoJDSD AWS account.

## Redirection to gov.uk

This approach is required for services that are being [transitioned to gov.uk](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/transition-a-site.html). This approach users a redirection service offered by GDS.

## Redirection to MoJ Maintenance Pages

This approach can be used for decommissioned domains or for services that need to be taken down for prolonged periods of time. This approach uses a custom created ["maintenance page"](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-maintenance-pages) that is hosted on the Cloud Platform.
