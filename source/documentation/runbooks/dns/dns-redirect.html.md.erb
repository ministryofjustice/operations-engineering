# Redirecting Domains

This runbook provides details of approaches to redirecting domains. There are different approaches depending on the scenario. Use this guide to identify the most suitable approach.

## Why might we need to redirect a domain?

There are a number of scenarios in which we may want to redirect a domain:
* decommissioning of a service
* replacement of a non-gov.uk domain with a gov.uk domain
* migration of a service from one domain name to a new domain name
* migration of a service to gov.uk

## CNAME redirection

This is the simplest form of redirect. You can use a [CNAME record](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html#CNAMEFormat) to redirect one domain to another e.g. redirect `example.service.justice.gov.uk` to `example.justice.gov.uk`.

This approach won't work where a `CNAME` shares the name with it's `Hostedzone` e.g. you can't create a CNAME `example.justice.gov.uk` in the Hostedzone `example.justice.gov.uk`. In this case you will need to redirect using AWS S3.

## Redirection with AWS S3 (HTTP traffic)

A more complex form of redirect will involve using AWS S3 to 'host' your redirection. This process involves creating a public S3 bucket which contains a website redirect. This is a standard feature of AWS S3.

Follow the [AWS documenation](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/redirect-domain-route-53) to set this up.

Few things to note when creating a redirect:
* S3 buckets are created in the MoJDSD AWS account
* This type of redirect won't work for HTTPS traffic. Instead see Redirection with AWS S3 (HTTPS traffic)
