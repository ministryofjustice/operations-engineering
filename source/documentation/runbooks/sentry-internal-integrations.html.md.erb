# Create a Sentry Internal Integration

This process is for creating a Sentry [Internal Integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/) for Service Teams.

Service Teams cannot create their own integrations as that requires too greater level of permissions. For that reason Operations Engineering will create the integration and send the team the token and client secret via a secure method. 

1. Login to [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/auth/login/)

2. Navigate to Settings > Developer Settings

3. Click on "New Internal Ingetration"

4. Add a `Name` (This should be provided by the Service Team e.g. `My Project CircleCI Deploy Integration`)

5. Set `Release` to `Admin`

6. Set `Organization` to `Read`

**Note - All other Permissions should be set to "No Access"**

7. Click "Save Changes" to create the integration.

8. Send `Token` and `Client Secret` to the Service Team via a secure method as agreed with the Service Team.

**Note - Do not post secrets in any public channels**
