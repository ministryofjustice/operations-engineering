# Add Docker User

> Docker Hub does currently have SSO setup at a PoC level, this document is mainly for backup process.

## Adding a Docker to the Ministry of Justice Docker Organization

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a MoJ's product of choice for implementation of container images

Users on Mac require a license to user Docker due to a change in Dockers model.

## Pre-requisites

You must have access to a Docker organization admin account either through:

* A personal Docker account
* The Operations Engineering Docker account (saved in LastPass)

> **Note** - HMPPS also has a Docker for Business subscription. It is possible that a user may want to be added to a repo within that organisation. If that is the case please redirect the user to the #hmpps_dev slack channel.

## Adding a User to the MoJ Docker Organization

1. Login into [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

2. Go to "Organizations".

3. Click on "ministryofjustice"

4. Click "Add Member".

5. Enter either the users email or Docker ID.

> e.g. ben.ashton@digital.justice.gov.uk / autoben
  
6. Select the team the user has requested or "pushers" if none specified
  
7. Click "Add"
  
8. Notify the user that an invite has been sent to their email
