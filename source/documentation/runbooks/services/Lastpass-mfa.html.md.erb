# LastPass Admin - Resetting User's MFA

MoJ mandates that users set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for LastPass. Users can choose which device and application that they want to set MFA up.

From time to time a user may need to set up MFA on a new device or want to change the MFA method. This requires an administrator to temporarily deactivate MFA for a user. When the users next logs in they will be forced to set up MFA.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

* Access to [LastPass Admin console](https://admin.lastpass.com/dashboard)
* User's details

## Deactivating MFA

1. Login to the LastPass Admin Dashboard.

2. Click on "Users" menu on the top toolbar. This will take you to the user admin page.

3. Search for the user.

4. Select the users by clicking on the check box next to their email address.

5. A set of options will appear above the users table. Select `Disable MFA`.

6. Click `OK`.

7. Notify the user that MFA has been temporarily disabled and that they can set up MFA again with a new app or new device.
