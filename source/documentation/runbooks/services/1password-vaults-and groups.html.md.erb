# Groups and Vaults

## Background

1Password has the concepts of Group and Vault.

* [Vault](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/) - Shared repository for passwords.

* [Group](https://support.1password.com/custom-groups/) - Specific set of users with permissions to access a specific Vault.

Groups have a [default set of permissions](https://ministryofjustice.1password.eu/security/default-vault-acl) set by an orgainsation level policy.

This is the system we use for access control. When we create users in 1Password we add users to a specific Group so that they have access limited to specific shared Vaults. Only Owners and Administrators can create Groups and Vaults (at the moment).

A user can be part of one or more Groups, that has access to one or more Vaults. 

Access to a Vault **must** be approved by the Vault owner. Owner details can be found in the Vault Description field.

## Create a new Group

A new Group may be required when a new Vault is created (see below), or if a different set of permissions is needed for a set of users on an existing Vault e.g. "Read-Only".

1Password [guide](https://support.1password.com/custom-groups/) can be followed to create a Group.

When created you can add exsiting users to the Group and add the Group to a Vault.

## Crate a new Vault

A new Vault may be created to share a new set of passwords. A new Vault can be linked to a new or existing Group.

1Password [guide](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/) can be followed to create a Vault.

When created you can add a new or existing Group to the Vault. 

**NB - Don't add users directly to a Vault. Their permissions my be incorrect as a result.**

**NB - When creating a Vault add the Owner's email address to the Description field e.g. `Owner: example@digital.justice.gov.uk`.**
