# Issue - Google Docs keyboard shortcut also used to open the 1Password browser extension

This is an FAQ.

You can open the 1Password Browser Extenion useing the Keyboard shortcut `⌘ + Shift + X`. However, this is the same keyboard shortcur for `strikethrough` in Google Docs. Users have reported trying to format a document using the shortcut only to have the 1Password extension continuosly popping up. 

## Fix

Advise the user to change the keyboard shortcut for 1Password via the [Google Chrome Extension Shortcut settings](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).
