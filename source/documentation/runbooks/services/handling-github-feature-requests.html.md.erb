# Runbook: Handling Third-Party GitHub Requests

## Objective:

To provide a structured, efficient process for tracking and addressing third-party feature requests to GitHub.

## Tools:

- [Third-Party Feature Requests GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/41/views/1)

- Monthly meetings with GitHub's Technical Account Manager

## Process:

1. **Issue Creation**: Developers and analysts create new feature request issues using the provided issue template in the operations-engineering repository. The issue is automatically tagged and added to the GitHub Project Board.

2. **Issue Status**: All new requests will be initially tagged as `New` on the GitHub Project Board. These are items that have not been discussed with GitHub yet.

3. **Monthly Review Meeting**: The Operations Engineering team convenes a meeting with a GitHub Technical Account Manager once a month. The main agenda for this meeting is to review the items on the GitHub Project Board.

4. **Check Progress**: At the meeting, the team first checks the progress of items that are already on the board. They review updates, discuss any roadblocks, and plan further action as necessary.

5. **Raise New Items**: After reviewing the progress of ongoing items, the team then raises new items tagged as `New`. They discuss the nature of the request, its potential benefits, and the feasibility of implementing it.

6. **Update Status**: After the meeting, the team updates the status of each item on the Project Board. Items might be moved from `New` to `In Progress`, `Complete`, or `Won't Do` based on the discussion.

7. **Communication**: The team communicates the progress of each request back to the issue's originator. This can be a brief update on the issue thread or a more detailed conversation if required.

## End of Process

The cycle repeats each month to ensure continuous tracking and resolution of feature requests.

Remember, our role is to facilitate and advocate for these requests. We aim to ensure that these requests are taken seriously by GitHub and addressed in a timely manner.
