# Branch Protection Settings and Issues Runbook

## Overview

As part of the MoJ GitHub repository standards it has been decided that certain Branch Protection settings should be enabled to create a safer environment on GitHub.

See the [Standards](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#building-software).

A repository that does not have the minimum Branch Protection settings will be non-compliant and an issue against the repository will be created per non enabled Branch Protection setting (Currently disabled).

See the [github-repository-standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards) repository.

The non-compliant repositories and created issues are recorded within the [Operations Engineering Reports](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) report, which is updated on a daily basis. It is generated by the [operations-engineering-reports](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering-reports) repository.

## Minimum Branch Protection Settings

The minimum Branch Protection settings for a repository are listed on [github-repository-standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards) repository.

## GH GraphQL Query

Below is some of the Branch Protection rules within GH that can be obtained from a GraphQL query. The comment on each line maps the the Branch Protection rule to the Branch Protection setting within the GH repository settings UI.

'''
  {
    repository(name: "repo-name", owner: "ministryofjustice") {

            requiresStrictStatusChecks        # Require branches to be up to date before merging
            requiresStatusChecks              # Require status checks to pass before merging

## How to implement a Branch Protection setting in Code

Two repositories are required to implement a Branch Protection check, raise an issue and add the details to the report. These are the [github-repository-standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards) repository and the [Operations Engineering Reports](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) repository.

The github-repository-standards repository contains the check and raises the issue on the repository (currently disabled).

The Operations Engineering Reports repository receives encrypted json data from github-repository-standards repository to display on [report site](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk).

The github-repository-standards repository Branch Protection check and raise issue against a repository are implemented using Ruby. A python script encrypts the json data and sends it to the report website. The report website decrypts the json data. The files to look at are:<br>

Note: Check the contents of the .json file after the script has completed to ensure the expected Branch Protection results are generated correctly.

Note: The json result data is passed between the two repositories therefore the variable/s names used in both repositories must match when either writing or reading the json data.

Note: Either on a branch or after the modifications have been merged onto the main branch the operations-engineering-reports [report](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) can be run manually on the CI [Continuous Deployment](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering-reports/actions/workflows/cd.yaml) to see the modifications within the report quicker rather than waiting for the scheduled report to occur.
