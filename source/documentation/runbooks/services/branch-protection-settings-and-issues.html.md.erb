# Branch Protection Settings and Issues Runbook

## Overview

As part of the MoJ Github repository standards it has been decided that certain Branch Protection settings should be enabled to create a safer environment on Github.

See the [Standards](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#building-software).

The MoJ Github repositories are scanned on a daily basis to find non-compliant repositories via a Github Action.

A repository that does not have the minimum Branch Protection settings will be non-compliant and an issue against the repository will be created per non enabled Branch Protection setting (Currently disabled).

See the [github-repository-standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards) repository.

The non-compliant repositories and created issues are recorded within the [Operations Engineering Reports](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) report, which is updated on a daily basis. It is generated by the [operations-engineering-reports](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering-reports) repository.

## Minimum Branch Protection Settings

The minimum Branch Protection settings for a repository are listed on [github-repository-standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards) repository.

## GH GraphQL Query

Below is some of the Branch Protection rules within GH that can be obtained from a GraphQL query. The comment on each line maps the the Branch Protection rule to the Branch Protection setting within the GH repository settings UI.

'''
  {
    repository(name: "repo-name", owner: "ministryofjustice") {
      branchProtectionRules(first: 100) {
        edges {

            dismissesStaleReviews             # Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

            requiredStatusCheckContexts       # Would apply to a .yml file I believe ie "terraform-plan"
            requiresApprovingReviews          # Require a pull request before merging
            requiresCodeOwnerReviews          # Require review from Code Owners
            requiresCommitSignatures          # Require signed commits
            requiresConversationResolution    # Require conversation resolution before merging
            requiresLinearHistory             # Require linear history
            requiresStrictStatusChecks        # Require branches to be up to date before merging
            requiresStatusChecks              # Require status checks to pass before merging

## How to implement a Branch Protection setting in Code

Two repositories are required to implement a Branch Protection check, raise an issue and add the details to the report. These are the [github-repository-standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards) repository and the [Operations Engineering Reports](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) repository.

The github-repository-standards repository contains the check and raises the issue on the repository (currently disabled).

The Operations Engineering Reports repository recieves encrypted json data from github-repository-standards repository to display on [report site](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk).

The github-repository-standards repository Branch Protection check and raise issue againt a repository are implemented using Ruby. A python script encrypts the json data and sends it to the report website. The report website decrypts the json data. The files to look at are:<br>

-  The [repository-checker](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards/blob/main/bin/repository-checker) script file that is executed when the CI is run. This is entry point and will require editing for any Branch Protection rules changes. The script will acquire the MoJ repository data via GH GraphQL call, check that the Branch Protection setting is enabled or not and raise an issue where required. The final task of the script is to create a .json file that contains the Branch Protection setting results.

-  The [repositories.rb](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards/blob/main/lib/repositories.rb) file contains the GH GraphQL query, these are the Branch Protection settings the repository-checker script will read.

-  The [standards_report.rb](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards/blob/main/lib/standards_report.rb) file parses the query data from repositories.rb. If new Branch Protection settings are to be used then this file will need to be edited to pass the result of the Branch Protection setting back to the repository-checker script. This is achieved either by adding the Branch Protection setting result as a new item in the *all_checks_result()* function or adding the data to the *report()* function.

-  The [issue_creator.rb](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards/blob/main/lib/issue_creator.rb) file is called by the repository-checker script when an issue should be raised against a repository. For new Branch Protection settings this file will need to be edited for each new rule. Each issue firstly does a check on the repository to see if an open issue already exists. If no issue exists then the issue is created on the repository with its own unique issue message.

Note: Check the contents of the .json file after the script has completed to ensure the expected Branch Protection results are generated correctly.

Note: The json result data is passed between the two repositories therefore the variable/s names used in both repositories must match when either writing or reading the json data.

Note: Either on a branch or after the modifications have been merged onto the main branch the operations-engineering-reports [report](https://operations-engineering-reports.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) can be run manually on the CI [Continuous Deployment](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering-reports/actions/workflows/cd.yaml) to see the modifications within the report quicker rather than waiting for the scheduled report to occur.
