# Add New Users to 1Password

These processes are for adding new users to the Ministry of Justice Enterprise LastPass account.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

* Access to [1Password Dashboard](https://ministryofjustice.1password.eu/home)
* New user name and work email address
* Details of the shared Vault that the user needs adding to
* Approval from Vault Owner to add new user

Note - Owner details are stored in the Vault Description field within 1Password

**1Password is only available to MoJ users/teams. We do not give access to 3rd party suppliers or anyone without an @digital.justice.gov.uk, @justice.gov.uk or @cica.gov.uk email address.**

**1Password is also only for shared Team credentials. Users must be added to a ["Group"](https://support.1password.com/custom-groups/). If access is just for personal use only, refer them to the [Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp).**

**Note - This is a two step process. A user will be invited to join the orgaisation (create an account, set up 2FA and install app etc). The users will then need to be added to the correct Group to enable access to a shared Vault.**

## Step 1 - Issue invite

1. Login to the 1Password Dashboard

2. Click on the "+" on the invitations section to bring up the box to add the users email address.

3. Add user email address and Click on the "Invite" button to submit. You can add multiple users one time. The user will be issued with an invitation email.

** Step 2 - Add user to Group

1. When the user has successfully created an account we will receive a notification to #operations-engineering-alerts slack channel.

2. Clicking on the link in the notification will take you to the admin dashboard where you can **Confirm** that the user is part of the MoJ organisation. You can do this via the "Awaiting Confirmation" section of the dashboard or by clicking on the Notification Bell (top right).

3. Now add the user to the Group that will set permissions for shared vaults. Navigate to the **Groups** page.

**Note - Most Vaults are associated with Groups with the same name, however in somecases this is not the case. You can check which Group has access to a specific Vault by viewing the Vault details.**

4. Find the correct Group and click on it to see Group Details.

5. Click on **Manage** button and find the users to add to the Group.

6. Save changes by clicking on the **Update Group Members** button. The user will now be able to see their shared Vaults.
