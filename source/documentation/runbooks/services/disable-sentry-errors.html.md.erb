# Disabling sending errors to a project in Sentry

## Overview

If an application becomes unhealthy it can begin to send thousands of errors at Sentry if there is no rate limiting built in, this can lead to using all the Sentry quota.
This page describes the steps on how to disable a project on Sentry and stop it sending errors in such a situation.

## Disabling errors

1. Navigate to the [Sentry Project Page](https://sentry.io/organizations/ministryofjustice/projects/)
2. Select the Project you wish to disable
3. Select the settings page (top right Cog wheel)
4. Navigate to Client Keys (DSN)
5. Select "Disable" for ALL keys.
6. Reduce to Rate Limit to 1 on all keys in the keys configure page
7. Using the relevant documentation from the [Sentry Docs](https://doc.sentry.io) - reduce the sample rate at the code level using the relevant SDK.
