# Issue - Users unable to import via the 1Password App

This is an FAQ.

As part of migration some users have reported being unable to import passwords when using the 1Password App. Upon investgation this is the correct behaviour of the app.

Even through we have enabled the ability for users to import passwords you can only use that feature of the app if you have the permissions to create vaults. At the moment we are not enabling users do do that whilst migration is still in progress due to risks relating to issues migrating shared passwords. Only Administrators and Owners have this permission.

## Workaround

User can be advised to import passwords via the browser version of 1Password which doesn't have the same permissioning restriction.

## Longer term fix

After migration is completed we should review user permissions which would allow users to access the import feature via the app.
