# Adding a GitHub repository to MoJ SonarCloud

## SonarCloud
SonarCloud performs a code analysis on a repository when a pull request is created. The information can be seen within the pull request or on the SonarCloud project page for the repository.

The Ministry of Justice has a SonarCloud Organisation account which Operations Engineering has taken ownership of.

All public repositories on the Ministry of Justice GitHub Organisation and the moj-analytical-services GitHub Organisation can use the SonarCloud analysis for free.

This runbook is for the Operations-Engineering team members on how to add a GitHub repository to SonarCloud and how to start an analysis of the repository.
