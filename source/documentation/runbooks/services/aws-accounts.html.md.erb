# Requests for AWS Account Access

Occasionally, we are asked by users for access to an existing AWS account.

**Note:** We do not create new AWS accounts. Service teams should be using either the Cloud Platform or Modernisation Platform.

## Requests for Modernisation Platform Access

Direct the requester to the `#ask-modernisation-platform` Slack channel.

## AWS Single Sign On (SSO)

The preferred method to access an AWS account is using [AWS SSO](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/). SSO utilizes GitHub Teams to set permissions for AWS accounts.

1. Confirm with the user which AWS account they need access to.

2. Confirm with the AWS Account Owner [see AWS Account List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lZ2ffiN_yQEYqTYnBzTbl16iElfrp3rZ8JnznDQWc-g/edit?usp=sharing) that the requester can have access to that account.

3. If approved, add the user to the appropriate GitHub Team [see team associations](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/aws-root-account/blob/main/management-account/terraform/sso-admin-account-assignments.tf).

4. Confirm to the requester when completed and send the [AWS SSO link](https://moj.awsapps.com/start/#/).

## AWS SSO Not Applicable

Some older AWS accounts are not enrolled in SSO. In those instances, direct the requester to the owner of that AWS account.
