# Add a Badge to a Repository

## Intro

* The Operations-Engineering team have created a public repository badge you can add to your repository landing page (ie README.md) that will display if a repository meets the MoJ [github repository standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards). This will not work with internal and private repositories.

* This is possible via https://img.shields.io

* A badge can either be static, dynamic, or a service.

* A static badge is fixed and does not change.

* A dynamic badge can do a API query and change the text value on the right side of the badge.

* A service badge connects to code on the shields.io repository to do a certain action, the result of the action change the value and color on the right hand side of the badge.

* For this example we are using a dynamic badge to query the operations-engineering report to obtain the JSON data regarding wether a repository is complaint or not.

* See the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/operations-engineering/discussions/1) on the operations-engineering team for an example of how the badge looks.

## Understanding the Badges

* The badge code at a high level looks like this: 
` 
	[![hover-text](badge-code)](OPERATIONS-ENGINEERING-REPORT-URL#REPO-NAME "Link to report")
`

* The badge code can be broken into these sections: 
`
	https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/ json ?color=blue &style=for-the-badge &logo=github &label=MoJ-Compliant &query=OPERATIONS-ENGINEERING-REPORT-JSON-DATA-PATH &url=OPERATIONS-ENGINEERING-REPORT-URL
`

* See the [shields.io](https://shields.io/) page to understand each section above or to make modifications.
