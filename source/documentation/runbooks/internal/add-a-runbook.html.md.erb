# Add a Runbook

## To add a new runbook:

* Create a new `*.html.md.erb` file in the `source/documentation/runbooks` directory of this repository, containing the runbook information
* Add a corresponding list item in the `source/documentation/runbooks.html.md.erb` file

> The link target should be `runbooks/[filename].html` i.e. if the runbook file is `source/documentation/runbooks/foobar.html.md.erb` then the link target should be `runbooks/foobar.html`

* Raise and merge a PR to add your changes to the `main` branch of this repository
