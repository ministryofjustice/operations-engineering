# Compiling the Operations Engineering Metrics pack

> Note: that whilst this is still mostly a manual process, effort is being made to automate most of this currently.

## Overview

The Operations Engineering team aim to provide a metrics pack as part of their service.

This metrics pack will allow for the following benefits to the team and MoJ:

* A clear indication of where the teams efforts have been placed.
* The ability to draw trends over time on the usefulness/quality of the teams services.
* Additional data to help cost cutting exercises.
