# Python best practice

## Introduction

This document is a guide to writing Python code in the Operations Engineering team. It is a living document, and will be updated as we develop a greater understanding of the language and how we intend to use it.

## General

### Use `autopep8` for code formatting

We should be using `autopep8` to format our code. This will ensure that all of our code is formatted in the same way, and will make it easier to read.

To install `autopep8`:

```bash
python -m pip install autopep8
```

To format a file:

```bash
autopep8 --in-place <filename>
```

### Use `pylint` for code linting

We should be using `pylint` to lint our code. This will ensure that our code is written in a consistent way, and will make it easier to read.

To install `pylint`:

```bash
python -m pip install pylint
```

To lint a file:

```bash
pylint <filename>
```
