# New Joiners Guide

When a new team member joins, follow this guide, and log completion in a ticket. You need to be a civil servant to complete the steps that require ServiceNow.

## Order MacBook / Kit
To get a MacBook (e.g. for a new starter), order it in ServiceNow, by searching for “Mac” (not MacBook!).
