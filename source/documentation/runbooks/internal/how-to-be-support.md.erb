# How to be Support

The intention of this document is to provide you with guidance on what to do while you're on 'Support'.

## What is Support?

Support is a role within the team that is responsible for responding customer queries and requests, as well as a number of monitoring tasks.
All members of the team are expected to contribute to the support rota, and to be available to respond to customer queries and requests.

It is important to note that while there is an individual on support at any given time, the team is expected to contribute and be available to assist where they can.

## How do we know who's on support?

The support rota is published on the [team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_rqkd9jdtg9kgditulka4ocit78%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).

## What's expected of us on support?

Note: This list is not exhaustive, and is subject to change. It was gathered during a slack conversation and is intended to be a starting point for discussion.

    1. Respond to customer queries and requests

The #ask-operations-engineering slack channel is our primary channel for customer queries and requests.
Monitor this channel and respond to queries and requests as they come in. If you don't know something, ask the team.

    2. Monitor the support inbox

There are a number of email groups you should monitor for customer queries and requests. They are:

- [Ops Eng Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.justice.gov.uk/g/operations-engineering)
- [Domains Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.justice.gov.uk/g/domains)
- [Certificates Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.justice.gov.uk/g/certificates)
- [Certificates Alerts Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.justice.gov.uk/g/certificate_alerts)

If a request comes in on the day you're on support, action it, unless the email is a follow on from a previous request.
If the email is a follow on from a previous request, add it to the existing ticket.

A few examples of the types of requests you'll receive in these mailboxes are:

TODO: Add runbooks for the following
- [Respond to certificates that have exipired/about to expire](/runbooks/internal/respond-to-expired-certificates.html)
- [Respond to leavers forms and remove their access](/runbooks/github/respond-to-leavers.html)


    3. Review documentation that has expired

Documentation in Operations Engineering is reviewed on a regular basis.
If a document was reviewed more than 3 months ago, it should be reviewed again. Expired documentation will appear in 
the #operations-engineering-alerts slack channel.

We use [Daniel the Manual Spaniel](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/09/25/keeping-tech-docs-up-to-date-with-daniel-the-manual-spaniel/)
to monitor our documentation. If a document has expired, it will be flagged in the #operations-engineering-alerts slack channel.
When you see this, review the document and raise a PR to update it. When finished add a tick emoji to the slack message.

    4. Monitor and review PRs in the Collaborators repository

The [Collaborators repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-collaborators/pulls) is used to manage
third-party access to our GitHub repositories. If a PR is raised, review it and contact the owner of the repository to confirm
the request.

If we have a number of requests at the same time, close them and add them to a single PR.

TODO: Add runbook for the following

You can read more about the [collaborators process here](/runbooks/github/collaborators.html)

    5. Monitor the #operations-engineering-alerts slack channel

The #operations-engineering-alerts slack channel is used to notify the team of any issues that need to be addressed.
If a major service is down (a service used by approximately 50% of users), 
send communication to the #operations-engineering-update slack channel.


## How do we volunteer for support?

To volunteer for support, add your name to the support rota on the [team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_rqkd9jdtg9kgditulka4ocit78%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).
