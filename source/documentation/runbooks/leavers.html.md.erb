# Leavers Guide

When a team member leaves, follow this guide, and log completion in a ticket.

## Revoking Access

### GSuite and Macbooks

The Service Desk will be able to remove and revoke access from a number of different accounts outside of Cloud Platform.

1. Google account closure, ordered in advance of them leaving, by creating a ServiceNow order [Return device for Digital Mac & WTP users](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a1f163211bb1a8507b10ca286e4bcb7a)

This is not just about returning their Mac - it will do the important step of closing their Google account. **Note: Include details in the ServiceNow request to transfer the leaver's Google Drive to someone in their team.**

### Access to Operations Engineering tools and services

1. Remove from [MoJ Github Organisation](https://github.com/ministryofjustice) **Note: Removal from GitHub will also remove access to other services that use this account for single sign-on i.e. AWS SSO, Sentry.io**

2. Remove them from [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) **Note: Removal from LastPass will remove access to shared team credentials for most services**

3. Remove them from [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/)
