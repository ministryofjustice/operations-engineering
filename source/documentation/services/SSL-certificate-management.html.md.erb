# Gandi.net SSL Certificates

## Overview

This process is for any Ministry of Justice users (or suppliers) requiring a Gandi.net SSL Certificate.

There are 2 categories of certificate we use at Ministry of Justice:

* AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) / Letâ€™s Encrypt - automated certificate management for modern cloud native software and infrastructure
* Gandi.net - where automated certificate management is not possible

## Automated Certificate Management
Where at all practicable we should utilise [automated certificate management](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/automated-certificate-renewal/#automated-certificate-renewal).

The MoJ Hosting Service is looking at strategy to move consumers to modern certificate management solutions.

## Gandi SSL Certificate Process

This process specifically relates to [Standard](https://docs.gandi.net/en/ssl/description/standard.html#standard-certificates) certificates issued through [Gandi.net]

1. Gandi send an email notification to the Operations-Engineering team one month prior to the SSL certificate expiry date.

2. The Operations-Engineering team will attempt to contact the SSL certificate responsible person/team. The first point of call is to check the emails from the previous year when the SSL certificate was generated.

3. The Operations-Engineering team will ask for a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

4. The person/team provide a CSR to the Operations-Engineering team.

5. The Operations-Engineering team will create or renew a SSL certificate in the Gandi portal.

6. Gandi will send an email to the Operations-Engineering team containing a CNAME entry. A CNAME is an alias to a record in a DNS registry.

7. The Operations-Engineering team will add the CNAME entry in AWS Route53 for the hosted zones / domains they are responsible for, or the Operations-Engineering team will email the CNAME entry to the responsible person/team and they will manually add it to their DNS.

8. Gandi will attempt to verify the CNAME against the CSR and once completed send the new SSL Certificate via email to the Operations-Engineering team.

9. The Operations-Engineering team will send the new SSL Certificate via email to the responsible person/team.

10. The person/team manually add the new SSL certificate to their DNS, or share the SSL certificate with a third party.

**The Operations-Engineering team do not handle any pass-phrases or keys regarding the CSR or SSL certificates.**

## Requesting a new certificate via Gandi.net

Complete the [MoJ Hosting Service SSL Certificate Request Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14XbWoudZd-t4-J3mDBcrAeafAbqxwvdkV-u3Zf8eLOs/edit?usp=sharing) and return it with the [Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](https://docs.gandi.net/en/ssl/common_operations/csr.html#generate-csr) (and an authority email approval if not an MoJ employee e.g. 3rd party supplier) to [certificates@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:certificates@digital.justice.gov.uk).

The Operations Engineering Team will create the new certificate and issue it, along with details of the expiry date (which will be in 12 months from date created), to the named contact provided in the request form.

When the certficate is created there is a validation step required. In most cases the Team manages the DNS so will complete this step. In instances where we do not manage a domain we will contact the requestor to assist in completing validation before the certificate can be issued.

Should you require intermediate or root certificates please contact [certificates@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:certificates@digital.justice.gov.uk).

## Renewal Process for Gandi.net SSL Certificates

Email reminders requesting new CSRs for Gandi.net certificates are automatically sent out via the [Operations Engineering Certificate Renewal](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering-certificate-renewal) repository to the appropriate recipients 30 days before expiry.

The frequency of these reminders can be configured via the `cert_expiry_thresholds` value in the `configs/production.yml` configuration file.

A list of the domains we managed and their respective owners can be found in the `mappings.json` file located in [this S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/operations-engineering-certificate-email?region=eu-west-2&tab=objects).

Once a reply is recieved, the Operations Engineering team can continue with the standard process to intiate the renewal.

## Revoking Gandi.net certificates

If an SSL certificate is no longer required e.g. a service has been decommissioned please contact [certificates@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:certificates@digital.justice.gov.uk), so that the team can revoke the certificate.

**Note that once a certificate has expired or been revoked it cannot be reinstated. If a certificate is required the process to request a new certificate should be followed.**

## Costs/Funding information

The costs for Gandi.net certificates are met centrally by Platforms & Architecture. There is no cross charge for using this service.
