We have an enterprise account with [Sentry.io].

All members of the [MoJ GitHub Organization] can create/signin to their
sentry.io account using this [self signup link].

In addition to error and custom even tracking, our Sentry plan now includes [performance monitoring].

Our plan includes 20mil transactions per month for all projects. In order for everyone to be able to make use of it, we recommend a sample rate of 5%. 

There might be limited value in sending transaction information for health and status endpoints and we suggest that those are filtered out. 

If you are only interested in a sub-section of your application routes, you can specifically opt in only those routes and increase your sample rate, for example if you're trying to debug a known performance issue and need a larger dataset.

If you would like to ensure spikes in errors do not affect Sentry usage, you can set up a [rate limit] per DSN key. This can be useful if you would like to control the amount of events staging or test environments can send, or if you don't want to be spammed with 100s of errors when something goes down for a bit longer. The value depends entirely on your project needs.

Below are some examples of performance monitoring config from MoJ projects: [Express], [Rails], [Django].
