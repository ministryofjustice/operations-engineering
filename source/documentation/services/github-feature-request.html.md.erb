# Making Feature Requests to GitHub

At the Ministry of Justice, we encourage developers and analysts to suggest improvements and new features that could enhance their experience with GitHub. Here's how you can submit a feature request:

## Step 1: Use the Issue Template

Begin by navigating to the [operations-engineering](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering) repository and select the 'Issue' tab. Click on the 'New issue' button. Choose the `GitHub Feature Request` issue template. This template contains relevant fields for your request and will help us track it effectively.

## Step 2: Define Your Feature Request

Your request should take the form of a user story with defined acceptance criteria. This will help us understand the context and the value your feature would provide.

```markdown
As a [Your Role],
I want [the feature or change],
So that [benefit/value].
```

For example:

```markdown
As a Developer,
I want to be able to deploy all of my code with a big red button,
So that I can make my life easier.
```

## Step 3: Submit the Issue

Fill out all the sections in the template, including the Acceptance Criteria and any additional notes or context. Then click 'Submit new issue'. This will automatically add relevant tags to your issue and place it on our `Third-Party Feature Requests Tracking` board on GitHub Projects.

## Step 4: Track Your Feature Request

You can now track the progress of your feature request through the [GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/41). Our Operations Engineering team meets with a GitHub technical account manager monthly, and your request will be discussed in these meetings.

We are here to make your experience with GitHub as productive and enjoyable as possible. If you have any questions or need any assistance, feel free to reach out to us via the #ask-operations-engineering Slack channel.

We look forward to hearing your ideas and working to make them a reality!

> Please replace `[Your Role]`, `[the feature or change]`, `[benefit/value]` with your actual role, the feature or change you want, and the benefit/value this feature or change will bring.
