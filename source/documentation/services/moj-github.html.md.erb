# Ministry of Justice (UK) GitHub Enterprise Management

The Operations Engineering team proudly manages the [Ministry of Justice GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/ministry-of-justice-uk). We maintain and support our enterprise instance, which includes several organisations:

- [Ministry of Justice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice)
- [MoJ Analytical Services](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services)
- [ministryofjustice-test](https://github.com/ministryofjustice-test)
- [Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority](https://github.com/CriminalInjuriesCompensationAuthority)

##Â Why We Use GitHub

GitHub is a powerful tool for software development and collaboration. Here's why we use it:

- Version Control: GitHub is built on Git, which tracks changes to our code over time. This ensures that every revision is documented, and we can revert to an older version if necessary.

- Collaboration: GitHub's collaborative features make it easy for our teams to work together, regardless of their physical location. Developers can contribute to projects, review code, and discuss changes.

- Integration: GitHub integrates well with many popular tools in the development ecosystem, allowing us to build efficient and flexible workflows.

## Our Services and Support

As the custodians of these GitHub organisations, our team is responsible for the following:

- **Access Management:** We handle user access control, ensuring the right people have access to the right resources.

- **Third-Party Collaborator Management:** We vet and manage collaborations with third-party developers, safeguarding the integrity of our projects.

- **Team Management:** Where teams lack a maintainer, we step in to manage team dynamics and operations.

- **Third-Party Application and Integration Approval:** We review and approve requests to integrate third-party apps, keeping our tech ecosystem secure and efficient.

- **Fine-Grained Personal Access Token Requests:** We oversee the approval of such requests, ensuring secure and proper usage of GitHub.

- **Repository Compliance:** We check that all repositories align with the [MoJ GitHub Repository Standards](https://operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/services/repository-standards.html).

- **Repository Templates Management:** We provide and manage templates for repositories, promoting best practices and consistency across projects.

- **Enterprise Support:** We liaise with GitHub to resolve any issues and to get support for our enterprise instance.

- **Account Automation:** We automate account management tasks like archiving inactive users and repositories, maintaining a clean and efficient workspace.

## GitHub Community Slack Channel

The Operations Engineering team also manages a Slack channel dedicated to all things GitHub under the name [#github-community](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C05L0KBA7RS).

The aim of the channel is to provide the following:

- A safe space for users to discuss anything and everything related to GitHub.

- An avenue for Operations Engineering to provide news and updates from GitHub, including changes made by us.

- A way to get feedback from our users to understand common pain points relating to GitHub.

- A place for users to learn new skills and share interesting discoveries.

We only ask that requests related to access are kept to the [#ask-operations-engineering channel](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4) in order for us to better track these types of requests.

### GitHub Community Rules

**Respect:** Always treat your colleagues with respect. Everyone is here to learn, contribute, and engage in productive discussions.

**Professional Conduct:** Keep the conversation professional. Avoid any content considered offensive, disruptive, or inappropriate in a workplace context.

**Relevance:** Keep discussions and shared content relevant to the focus of this channel, which is sharing knowledge and best practices around development and analysis within the Ministry of Justice.

**Constructive Feedback:** When providing feedback, ensure it is constructive, respectful, and aimed at promoting growth and learning. Avoid personal criticism.

**Avoid Spam:** Refrain from posting unnecessary or repetitive content, advertising, or spam.

**Confidentiality:** Do not share sensitive or confidential information. Follow all the Ministry of Justice guidelines regarding data security and privacy.

**Problem-solving:** If you're posting about a problem or issue you've encountered, provide as much detail as you can to make it easier for others to help.

**Engage and Participate:** Join in, ask questions, answer queries, and share your knowledge! The more you participate, the more valuable this community will be for everyone.

## Making Feature Requests to GitHub

We encourage developers and analysts to suggest improvements and new features to GitHub. Please visit the [Making Feature Requests to GitHub Guide](https://operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/services/github-feature-request.html) for detailed instructions on how to submit your feature request and track its progress.

## Managing GitHub Notifications

It's crucial for productivity and sanity to keep the volume of notifications manageable. Given that the use of GitHub across our different projects can generate a large number of notifications, we've compiled a guide to help you control and manage your notifications effectively.

This guide covers understanding the source, turning off default settings, email notification management, and some best practices to ensure that you don't miss any important updates. Visit our [Managing GitHub Notifications Guide](https://runbooks.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/services/github/managing-github-notifications.html) to learn more.

Remember, effective management of your notifications can greatly enhance your GitHub experience by reducing unnecessary noise and focusing on the updates that matter most to you.

## Open Source by Default

We're committed to open source by default. We believe that open source is the best way to build software, and we're proud to contribute to the open source community. We encourage our teams to open source their projects whenever possible.

### What to store in a public repository

Public repositories are open to the public. Anyone can view and contribute to them. We've written a "Do's and Don'ts Guide" to help you decide what to store in a public repository. Visit our [What to Store in a Public Repository Guide](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/storing-code-in-public.html) to learn more.
