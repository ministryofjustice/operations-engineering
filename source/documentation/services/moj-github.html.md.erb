# Ministry of Justice (UK) GitHub Enterprise Management

The Operations Engineering team proudly manages the [Ministry of Justice GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/ministry-of-justice-uk). We maintain and support our enterprise instance, which includes several organisations:

- [Ministry of Justice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice)

##Â Why We Use GitHub

GitHub is a powerful tool for software development and collaboration. Here's why we use it:

- Version Control: GitHub is built on Git, which tracks changes to our code over time. This ensures that every revision is documented, and we can revert to an older version if necessary.

- Collaboration: GitHub's collaborative features make it easy for our teams to work together, regardless of their physical location. Developers can contribute to projects, review code, and discuss changes.

- Integration: GitHub integrates well with many popular tools in the development ecosystem, allowing us to build efficient and flexible workflows.

## Our Services and Support
