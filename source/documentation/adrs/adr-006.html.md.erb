# ADR-006 Require authentication for team reports

## Status

✅ Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering reports are currently completely public. This means they are limited to public repositories. As a result they do not represent the complete code estate of the MoJ organisation.

## Decision

If the user is not authenticated, keep the current view of only public repositories. Authenticated users can view an enhanced version which includes private and public repositories.

## Consequences

Private and internal repositories can be included in the reports, allowing a complete view over the estate.
