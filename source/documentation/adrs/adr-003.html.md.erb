# ADR-003 DNS Failover

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering manages the Route53 DNS estate for MoJ, we are responsible for the following:

1. Entry of new DNS records
2. Decommission of old records
3. Management of defensive domains
4. Renewal of records

## Decision

The decision to not offer DNS failover was made for the following reasons:

1. Route53 is already highly available and runs on a 100% uptime SLA (Service-level Agreement)
2. The technical effort of implementing failover is not worth the reduction in risk

## Consequences

A full Route53 lasting longer than the various caching outage would result in downtime for the various domains in Route53.
