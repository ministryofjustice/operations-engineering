# ADR-005 Github Standards Branch Protection

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering owns and looks after the [Github Repository standards] for the MoJ organisation. We are in the process of reviewing them in order to make sure they work for the community.

Our current brach protection requirements do not fit the way every team works and so a lot of teams are accepting non-compliance. Our aim is for these standards to be a sensible minimum and currently they are not working for everyone.

## Decision

Change the requirement for branch protection of main from:

* Require a pull request before merging
* Require approvals option and a minimum number of user to approve the pull request.
* Require review from Code Owners option
* Include administrators option

to:

* Require a pull request before merging
* Require approvals option and a minimum number of user who is a member of MoJ to approve the pull request
* Include administrators option

## Consequences

This decision ensures code still needs to be reviewed by at least one other person who is a member of MoJ organisation, but does not require that to be a code owner. This allows for shared support workflows to continue without being non-compliant without exposing the MoJ to more risk.
