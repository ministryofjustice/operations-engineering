# ADR-004 Docker SSO

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering manages the Docker organisation for the MoJ. Docker have now introduced Single Sign-On (SSO) as an option for people to authenticate. We have set this up with Auth0.

We use Github as our identity provider.

## Decision

Use Docker SSO as the primary login method for the MoJ Docker organisation.

## Consequences

We have already onboarded quite a few people and some might end up with two accounts. This can be prevented by adding a user's digital.justice.gov.uk email to their Docker profile. On a subsequent SSO the accounts will be merged.
