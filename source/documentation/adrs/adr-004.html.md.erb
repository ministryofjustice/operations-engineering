# ADR-004 DNS Failover

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering manages the Docker organisation for the MoJ. Docker have now introduced Single Sign-On (SSO) as an option for people to authenticate. We have set this up with Auth0.

We use Github as our identity provider. This means that when someone joins or leaves the MoJ Github organisation, this will be reflected in the Docker organisation.

## Decision

Use Docker SSO as the primary login method for the MoJ Docker organisation.

## Consequences

We have already onboarded quite a few people and some might end up with two accounts. This can be prevented by adding a user's digital.justice.gov.uk email to their Docker profile. On a subsequent SSO the accounts will be merged.
