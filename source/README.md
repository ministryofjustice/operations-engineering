# Source Files

The source files in this folder are html.md.erb files.

They are not written in HTML.

It is more like Markdown.

A hash represents a header `<h1>, <h2>,` etc.

See the [link](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/configure_project/structure_docs/#structure-your-documentation) for more details.

Files are relatively linked to each other using this approach `[text](documentation/alliance/alliance)`

Filenames must be `[something].html.md.erb`

Webpages are laid out using index.html.md.erb files and folders. See the [link](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/configure_project/structure_docs/#structure-your-documentation) for more details.
