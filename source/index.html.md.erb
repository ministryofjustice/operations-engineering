# MoJ Operations Engineering

## Our vision

The goal of Operations Engineering falls into 3 broad areas:

* Developing easy to adopt shared tooling for Service Teams so that we solve problems once for reuse on any hosting platform.

* Centralised ownership of 3rd party products and tools used across the organisation to ensure accountability for software on which we rely for building and supporting services, enable better scalability, and to ensure best value for money.

* Setting and encouraging compliance with technical standards to improve code quality and security.

While we will use the Cloud Platform for developing and hosting our services, as a team the tools and standards we create will be made readily available across multiple platforms and hosting services across the organisation.
